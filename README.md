# Eachine Racer 130 mods

3D printable components to modify your Racer 130. Replaces the standoffs, top plate, front shroud.

I did this because initially the stock flight controller died, and I replaced it with an Omnibus F3 mini, which has different mounting holes. Then I decided I preferred the RunCam Swift Micro, and Eachine VTX03 video transmitter, and cloverleaf antenna, and WS811 LED. You get the picture. All that and a full canopy comes in at ~2g less than stock!
